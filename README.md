## Overview

This repository contains the analytical code used to investigate how adult-infant neural coupling mediates the selection of socially-relevant stimuli for learning in both British and Singaporean infant populations. The analysis focuses on neural synchrony between adults and infants during social interaction, and how this relates to learning outcomes.
